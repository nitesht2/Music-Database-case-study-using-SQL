# Exploratory Data Analysis in SQL


## Introduction

I'll be working with a modified version of a database called Chinook. The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store.

The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables.
## Project Planning
- Data Collection: Get the required dataset and upload it into SQL Server
- Data Cleaning: Transform the data as required and make sure it is ready for analysis.
- Data Analysis: Write queries using SQL and use multiple condidtions and techniques to answer the business questions.
- Result: Insights were generated from the analysis and data visualization.
## Data Collection
Created database named Chinook music database

## Data Preparation
- Examined the relationship between the tables.
- Made sure that each column is of a suitable data type.
- Made sure that the data fit for the analysis using Entity relationship diagram
